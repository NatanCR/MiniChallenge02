# MiniChallenge02
In this Mini Challenge proposed by the Apple Developer Academy, we had free rein to work on the development of the app. So, based on our construction process, we created the Tero app, which aims to help introduce recycling into children's education.

Thinking about how this could be positive for encouraging environmental preservation, a game was developed to address an important issue in a playful way.
